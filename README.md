# Introduction to Kate, A Statistical Computing Beginner

## About Me!

Hello! I'm Kate, a second year MSPH student in the global disease epidemiology and control track. I completed my undergraduate degree in physiology from McGill University in Montreal, though I'm originally from Toronto. I was lucky enough to grow up around the world but I'm currently living in Puno, Peru working on a study related to hypertension and diabetes management in a low-resource Andean population. 

In my first year at Hopkins, a focused most of my stats training on Stata and have been using Stata for data analysis during my practicum. This year, I'm really keen to become more proficient with R as it's such a powerful resource in epidemiology and beyond. I'd love to leave this course feeling like I had a firm grasp on R basics that I could bring forward and build on with future projects. 

## Some fun(ish) facts:

- I love playing water polo
- I've lived on five continents 
- My dog and I have matching Peruvian llama sweaters 
- I love baking and eating sourdough bread (even the failures)
- I prefer to eat kiwi fruit with the skin on

## A link I like! 

This is a really interesting article about Lake Titicaca, which is where I'm living right now: https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20220814-the-floating-homes-of-lake-titicaca
